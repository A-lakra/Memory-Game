# Memory-Game
This project is a simple memory game built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (with jQuery). The game generates a sequence of colors, and the player has to repeat the sequence correctly to advance to the next level. Each new level adds an additional color to the sequence, testing the player's memory as the game progresses.
